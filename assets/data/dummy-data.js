      "Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge is a living root bridge in Meghalya, India. It can be reached via trekking 45 km from Cherapunji. The trek is 6500 steps. There is also a waterfall nearby. Due to tourism, the health of the root bridge has degraded.\n\n Meghalaya presented the root bridge at its 70th Republic Day ceremony. A replica of the bridge has been made in Nangrighat in Cherrapunji to present the Khansi and Jaintia people's craft of building bridges from the secondary roots of trees.\n\n These living bridges are grown from a special type of rubber tree. As the roots grow, so the strength of the bridge increases.\n\n The root bridges are honoured as the Tajmahal of Meghalaya. They take around 25 years to grow and operate, but can carry the weight of 50 people and go on functioning for 500 years.",

The lake was formed when a dam was built over the Umiam River in the early sixties as part of a hydel power project. Umiam Lake has become a favourite spot for many who come to admire the landscape.\nThe adjoining Orchid Lake Resort is a government-run facility where you can book lodges or grab a bite at the restaurant with fine views. The resort swimming pool, with its dramatic location on the edge of the hill overlooking the lake, is also open to visitors. Umiam Lake is Shillong’s major hub for water sports and boating. Paddle boats, water scooters, and speed boats are some of the plentiful options for those who look to hit the waters. There are many other resorts tucked in the serene lakeside woods where you can spend time amidst the quiet, natural surroundings.",

Arwah Cave was discovered until recently and was least explored. It is very dark and creepy inside especially when crawling through the narrow tunnels. There are many chambers and narrow passages in the cave.\n\n  Sarwah Caves are known for their limestone formations and the fossils which are believed to be millions of year old. The explorers and adventure lovers have spotted various fossils in the shape of the fish, dog skull etc. The formations inside the cave are bend and carved naturally in a manner that people can pass through them easily.

      "At a distance of 57 km from Shillong, Kyllang Rock is a massive red granite dome-shaped rock located at Mawshut in West Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. Locally, known as Lum Kyllang, it is one of the unique tourist places in Meghalaya and among the interesting places to visit near Shillong.\n\nThis monolithic structure stands 5400 feet above the sea level and has a width of 1000 feet. It is a mammoth block of granite which is part of the Khasi folklore and seems beautiful in its shape. The Bright red granite is claimed by the geologists to be several million years old. The rock can be approachable from its northern and eastern sides but remains unapproachable from the southern flank. The southern side of Kyllang Rock is laden with massive detached blocks of rock while the northern part of the rock is enveloped with dense forest.\n\nSurrounded by age old Red Rhododendrons, Kyllang Rock is believed to have magnetic properties. Due to this magnetic field, anything doesn't fall down from this rock. It makes this place a unique attraction for tourists. Besides, it is also an ideal place for trekkers and adventure lovers. A hike to the top of the dome allows you to treasure the marvelous landscape of the surrounding area.",

      "Compared to the cliff-hugging plunge falls that you will find in Southern Meghalaya, the Krangshuri waterfall features a different aesthetic. A placid river suddenly drops, creating a curtain of flowing water that falls over a cave.\n\nFrom afar, Krangsuri is a sight that will make you think of the Jungle Book. During the summer, blue, clear waters can be seen at the bottom of the waterfalls which itself is located in the middles of a thickly forested area.\n\nThe walk down to Krangshuri is a pleasant descent – you begin on an open meadow and slowly climb down into more defined shrub and vegetation. There are railings around the falls where you can get a good view and you can also inquire about the boating facilities there. Upstream is a small space where people can camp, surrounded by lush green vegetation and with the gentle ripple of the river for company. On calm sunny days, you can enjoy a dip in the pool of the waterfall after renting life jackets. Shutterbugs will certainly enjoy strolling around the surrounding hills looking for a vantage point, of which there are many. Just make sure you watch your step and wear footwear with good grip as the rocks around the water can be slippery.\n\nGetting there – The 90-km drive to Krangshuri from Shillong via the NH6 and NH206 is a riveting one – highways looping around the gentle hills, punctuated by hamlets and small towns. There are plenty of eating choices for those who are ready to try local food.",

Literally called as 'Garden of monoliths', the Monoliths Park is one of the renowned monuments in Meghalaya and among the well-known tourist places in Jowai.\n\nMonoliths exist throughout the length and breadth of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. However, the biggest collection of monoliths in one single area is to be found in Nartiang, the summer capital of the Jaintia rulers. According to legend, the cluster of monoliths erected to mark the reigns of the erstwhile Jaintia Kings. Some scholars also say that these monoliths were erected in memory of the establishment of the market from Raliang to Nartiang. The site has been declared of national importance under the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958.\n\nThese monoliths cover a wide complex of about 100 m in diameter. The Menhirs (Upright stones) are locally known as Ki Moo Shynrang, and Dolmens (flat stones in the horizontal position) are known as Ki Moo Kynthai. Moo Iong Syiem, the tallest and biggest of the monoliths, is about 8 m in height, 2 m in breadth and 0.46 m in thickness. It was erected by U Marphalyngki, a trusted lieutenant of the Jaintia kings. The followers of the erstwhile Jaintia Kings U Marphalyngki and U Luh Lyngshkor Lamare erected the other monoliths in the early 17th century.",

A trip to Tura Peak brings you up close to the beauty, as you climb up to one of the highest points in the district.\n\nThe moderately difficult Tura Peak hike – most visitors complete the journey in an hour or ninety minutes – is filled with scenery. The thick vegetation of the middle range gives way to cooler, temperate scenery as you approach the top. There is a tower on the summit from where you can soak in some stunning vistas of the town and the ranges beyond. Spot the winding Jinjiram River as it careens through the hills and drains into the western plains.",

      "Visiting Siju Cave is like entering the belly of the earth, a place of unique visuals and formations that will capture anyone’s imagination.\n\nOn the way, you get to enjoy a short hike through the jungle, including places where you step over rushing mountain streamlets. A railed pathway has been constructed which takes you through an area of astounding rock formations hidden in the dense vegetation. You then reach the grand and tall arched entrance of Siju cave. As you enter deeper into the labyrinth, watch the light of the outside world become a speck. There are many bats that call this place home – Siju translates to bat cave – and you can also follow some of the underground streams, clear and unpolluted. There are ponds and waterfalls in the cave system.\n\nSiju cave’s full extent has not been mapped but we already know it is one of the longest cave systems in the world. The State Department of tourism runs a tourist lodge at Siju set amidst leafy surroundings, a perfect base as you explore the cave and the adjacent places of interest. If you are interested in an in-depth exploration of the cave with the proper gear and guidance, the Meghalaya Adventurers Association organizes caving trips.\n\nIt is not just the legendary cave that makes Siju very enticing. The Siju Bird Sanctuary is a great place for nature lovers. The forests here are a stop for many migratory species like Siberian ducks and endemic residents include hornbills and the rare peacock pheasant. The Simsang river and nearby reserve will give you an up-close experience with the indomitable Garo Hills terrain and wilderness.",
